# 16---Bit-Computer
This project implements a simple 16-bit computer as part of the Computer Architecture and Organization course at Addis Ababa Institute of Technology. It supports a custom instruction set with 3-bit opcodes and performs basic arithmetic, data transfer, and bit-manipulation operations.

ðŸ”§ Features
  16-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
  
  ADD, SUB, INC, DEC operations
  
  Logical Shift Operations
  
  Logical Left Shift
  
  Logical Right Shift
  
  Data Transfer Instructions
  
  Store (Accumulator â†’ Memory)
  
  Load (Memory â†’ Accumulator)
  
  Overflow detection for arithmetic operations
  
  Modular design with registers, multiplexers, decoders, and control logic

  Central accumulator for all instruction outputs

ðŸ§± Core Components
Register A & B for user inputs

16-bit Accumulator Register

Main Memory Register for temporary storage

3-to-8 Opcode Decoder

Universal Shift Register with control multiplexers
